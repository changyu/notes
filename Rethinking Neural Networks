Title: Rethinking Neural Networks: Are We Overexerting Them? A Biological Perspective on Better Solutions

Abstract
This paper explores the premise that current neural networks may be overexerting their capabilities by attempting to model the world too precisely, a task for which they may not be optimally designed. Drawing inspiration from the evolutionary development of biological neural networks, which have evolved primarily for survival rather than for an accurate representation of reality, the paper argues that a more effective approach to artificial intelligence (AI) design could involve a modular architecture, akin to the functional compartmentalization seen in the human brain. This paper proposes that such an architecture could lead to improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and overall performance by leveraging the strengths of specialized modules while mitigating the weaknesses of current neural network designs.

Introduction
Biological neural networks, including the human brain, have evolved over approximately 600 million years with the primary objective of survival. Their architecture, while effective for this purpose, is not necessarily designed to accurately reflect the world as it truly is. The development of science and the capacity for logical reasoning are fortuitous byproducts of the brain's evolution, rather than its primary functions.

However, it would not be incorrect to assert that the brain’s capacity to understand the world has a certain inevitability. The fundamental components of the universe—three major categories of basic particles—give rise to atoms and molecules, which in turn interact to form the emergent properties of nature. Similarly, the complex systems of life, society, and civilization arise from the interactions of smaller, simpler entities. Emergence, a fundamental property of complex systems, is what allows the diversity and complexity of the world as we know it.

The brain itself is a complex system, and intelligence is merely an emergent property of the interactions among a vast number of neurons. While intelligence might seem extraordinary, it is simply a common characteristic of complex systems. Lower-level complex systems exhibit simpler forms of intelligence, such as water droplets that intuitively find the quickest path from a mountain to the sea. Higher-level systems, like various biological organisms, exhibit more sophisticated forms of intelligence.

The Evolutionary Purpose of the Brain
The primary purpose of the brain is survival, optimizing the chances of living with the least amount of energy expenditure. The brain, encased in darkness and silence, relies on limited signals from sensory organs to interpret the external world. It processes these signals through approximations, calculations, and a form of imaginative fitting based on past experiences. This process is highly efficient but does not guarantee precision, accuracy, or even correctness. This is why biological systems rarely exhibit perfect lines or angles; they operate with a degree of randomness. Yet, regardless of their flaws, this is how our brains function.

Despite its significant limitations in precision, the brain is capable of fitting or understanding highly complex, multidimensional functions. Just as Fourier transforms can fit any function with infinite terms, the brain can use an almost infinite number of dimensions to express, understand, and compute the interactions between various entities, predicting trends and trajectories. This ability enhances survival in both the present and the future. However, past memories, when retrieved, are re-fitted and corrected based on the latest data to improve future recall, though this process inherently involves some distortion. Therefore, while memories are crucial for survival, they do not necessarily represent the factual truth.

The Case for Modular AI Architectures
Neural networks in AI can be understood as functions fitting data through a process of approximation. The smaller the interval, the easier the fit; the larger the interval, the more data points are required, increasing the difficulty. Thus, partitioned training is easier and less costly, whereas global training is more difficult, requiring larger datasets and leading to greater error, potentially giving rise to AI hallucinations.

Biological brains have functional compartments, with different regions responsible for different tasks. These regions are not isolated; they communicate and cooperate with one another. There is also a degree of competition among them, allowing for interaction, verification, and mutual improvement through evolution.

Modern AI should adopt a similar approach, utilizing multiple functional compartments. Each compartment should be trained with its specialized dataset, resulting in more accurate outcomes and reduced overall training volume. Since neural networks excel at generalization but are less adept at precise memory and computation, a supervisory AI module should be trained to decompose tasks and oversee their integration. This module would first break down incoming tasks, assign different components to specialized AI units (e.g., chemistry to a chemistry unit, biology to a biology unit), and then validate, correct, and integrate the results to ensure accuracy before moving to the next step, culminating in the final output.

For memory, specialized AI modules with vector databases should handle tasks to ensure accuracy. Numerical computations should be delegated to CPUs, while vector computations are handled by GPUs to enhance precision and efficiency. This design, inspired by the logic of the biological brain, plays to the strengths of AI while avoiding inherent weaknesses in memory and computational accuracy.

Conclusion
The current approach to neural network design may be overextending their capabilities by demanding precision and accuracy that they are not inherently equipped to handle. By drawing lessons from the compartmentalized architecture of biological neural networks, AI can be restructured to perform more efficiently and effectively. A modular approach, where specialized AI systems work together under the supervision of a coordinating module, offers a promising direction for the future of artificial intelligence. This architecture not only mirrors the strengths of the human brain but also addresses its limitations, leading to a more robust and capable AI system that better serves its intended purposes.

This proposal underscores the importance of not just mimicking biological systems, but understanding their underlying principles to guide the development of more sophisticated and resilient artificial intelligence.
