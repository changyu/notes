Title: The Conflict between Profit-Driven Consumption and the Medical Industry: The Contradiction of Fast Fashion and Medical Durability


Abstract

In the current capitalist economic system, the pursuit of profit drives behavior not only in consumer markets but also in the medical industry, leading to sharp conflicts between these profit motives and the needs of consumers and patients. This paper explores how capital maximizes profits by promoting fast fashion consumption and avoiding product durability and examines how these profit-driven behaviors manifest in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in drug development and dental care practices. Through this analysis, the paper further discusses how, in a system not driven by profit but truly centered on people, technology could better serve humanity.

Introduction

The core driving force of the capitalist economic system is profit maximization, which profoundly influences various fields, from consumer markets to the medical industry. In consumer markets, the rise of fast fashion exemplifies how capital drives cyclical consumption and reduces product durability to stimulate purchasing. Similarly, in the medical industry, pharmaceutical companies develop drugs that ensure long-term patient dependency rather than cures, thereby maximizing profits. This paper aims to analyze the conflict between these profit-driven behaviors and the needs of consumers and patients, and to explore how technological progress could create more sustainable benefits for humanity if it were truly people-centered.

Profit-Driven Fast Fashion Consumption

The core concept of fast fashion is to stimulate consumption through rapid production and frequent updates. Capital produces low-cost, low-durability clothing and goods, forcing consumers to replace them frequently, thereby maximizing profits. This model not only increases consumption frequency but also reduces product lifespan, driving excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation. However, from the consumer's perspective, long-lasting products are clearly more economical and practical, creating a conflict between consumer demand and capital-driven production.

Profit-Driven Behavior in the Medical Industry

In the medical industry, the pursuit of profit is equally evident. Pharmaceutical companies tend to develop drugs that require long-term use rather than drugs that can cure diseases outright. While patients hope for a quick cure, from a capital perspective, such a cure would cut off a revenue stream. As a result, symptom-management drugs, such as painkillers, have become the most profitable products in the industry. This profit-driven behavior not only diverges from patients' health needs but also raises ethical questions, especially in the treatment of chronic and serious diseases.

Profit-Driven Practices in Dental Care

Dental care is another area where the conflict between profit and patient needs is apparent. Advanced materials, such as high-strength polymers and ceramics, are available today and could fully encapsulate teeth to prevent cavities. However, this technology has not been widely adopted because it would reduce the frequency and revenue of dental treatments. This phenomenon reveals that in a profit-driven economic system, the application of medical technology is often limited by capital interests rather than prioritizing the long-term health of patients.

People-Centered Technological Applications

How could technological progress better serve humanity if the economic system were not driven by profit but truly centered on people? First, in the consumer sector, product design would focus more on durability and environmental sustainability, reducing resource waste and environmental pollution. Second, in the medical industry, the focus of research and development would shift toward genuine cures and prevention, reducing the long-term burden and suffering of patients. Finally, in fields like dental care, advanced materials and technologies would be widely used to achieve a preventive health management model.

Conclusion

The inherent nature of profit-seeking in both consumer markets and the medical industry has led to significant conflicts of interest. The current state of fast fashion and pharmaceutical development demonstrates that under the drive for maximum profit, the long-term needs of consumers and patients are often neglected. If the economic system could shift toward a people-centered development model, technological progress could better serve the well-being of humanity. By reducing excessive product consumption and improving the efficiency of medical technology application, we can build a more sustainable and healthy social system.
